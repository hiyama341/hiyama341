Hey there! 

As a PhD student at DTU, I'm currently exploring the integration of Python into the field of biology, specifically in high-throughput strain construction. 

To that end, I've collaborated with researchers at DTU to create a Python package called [teemi](https://github.com/hiyama341/teemi), which utilizes literate programming for high-throughput strain engineering.

Feel free to check out my repositories on GitHub or contact me through email if you're interested in collaborating with me on this exciting area of research. I'm always looking for exciting collaborations - so please don't hesitate to reach out.
